# Hi there, I'm Atmadeep! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about **mastering C++ for competitive programming and DSA**â€”from writing robust backend logic to crafting inegenious algorithms. This repository is my progress journalâ€”a collection of learning notes, project logs, and resource links.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning

Hereâ€™s a list of topics Iâ€™m actively learning or have already covered:

### Programming

**Python Programming**

## ðŸš© Goals and Next Steps

- Strengthen fundamentals in C++
- Understand how to solve a problem from Smart India Hackathon
- Participate in Hackathons 
- Document projects and share learning resources
